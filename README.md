# 🐦 Flappy Bird Clone - Java Game Project

A fully playable desktop clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game developed using **Java**, **Swing**, and **AWT** libraries. This project is ideal for students or beginners who want to learn Java GUI programming and basic game development logic.

---

## 📖 Introduction

This project is a clone of the popular **Flappy Bird** game, implemented using Java. The game involves a bird flying through a series of pipes without hitting them. It demonstrates object-oriented programming, GUI design, graphics rendering, and event-driven game control in Java.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Java Swing
- Java AWT
- Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time gameplay using `javax.swing.Timer`
- Bird jump mechanics with gravity effect
- Dynamic top and bottom pipe generation
- Collision detection (bird and pipes or ground)
- Score tracking system
- Game over and restart capability (on rerun)

## 🎮 How to Play

- Press the **Spacebar** to flap upward.
- Avoid hitting the top and bottom pipes.
- You score a point for each set of pipes passed.
- Game ends on collision or hitting the ground.
- To play again, rerun the program.

## 🔍 Code Overview

### `Flappybird.java`

This file contains:

- `main()` method – game entry point
- Game loop – uses a Swing `Timer` to repaint the screen at fixed intervals
- `paint()` method – draws background, pipes, bird, and score
- Keyboard handling – spacebar event to make the bird "flap"
- Gravity simulation – bird falls over time unless it flaps
- Collision detection – checks if the bird hits a pipe or the ground
